How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    We can trace back the changes and check which changes are not we desired . And then we can reverse them back

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can compare two different versions
We can trace bugs more easily
we can restore to any version back in time
We can undo changes and correct our mistakes. It’s like going back in time to do things the way you want.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros of manual committing : Logically this will be more accurate. As we will able to cluster changes in a better way
	Number of versions would be limited and more user-defined. So more ease of understanding

cons: manual error may come in. Sometimes the user might simply forget committing


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Version control systems like GIT are dealing with files that are inter-related so saving multiple files in one commit is useful and necessary

However , in vis like google docs, it’s usually a single file that’s changed so saving multiple file in one commit does not makes much sense.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will give us a log of all the commits
With “git diff” we can find the difference between any commit in the past and the present version

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    With version control we can easily move back to code which was working , if the current code has some bugs in it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To develop mobile app. Need to understand git to download good modules to fit into my app.
