When would you want to use remote repository, rather than storing on your local directory?
When multiple people might want to make changes to a same file
When we want to access files from multiple location


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If git automatically syncs with our local repository then there might be many commits which are logically not accurate, i.e. they do not define a single logical change
