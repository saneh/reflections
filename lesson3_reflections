When would you want to use remote repository, rather than storing on your local directory?
When multiple people might want to make changes to a same file
When we want to access files from multiple location


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If git automatically syncs with our local repository then there might be many commits which are logically not accurate, i.e. they do not define a single logical change


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork : is a copy of a git repo on git-hub into another account on gib -hub
Clone : When you download a git repo from git-hub onto your local machine
Branches:branch is a series of reachable commit starting from the tip of the branch i.e. the last commit

Fork is for cloning other projects on git-hub, when we also want to link back to the original and need to make a copy on gib-hub itself

Clone , when we download the repo so that we can make our changes offline
Branch When we wan too add a commit in a logical sequence

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
With a copy of last known state we can easily pull any changes made in the remote, also with git diff ew can compare what new changes are added in the meantime
